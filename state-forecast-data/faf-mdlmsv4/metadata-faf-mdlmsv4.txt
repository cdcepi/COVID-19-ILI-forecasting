this_model_is_an_ensemble: TRUE
methods: Bayesian Multivariate Dynamic Linear Model with covariance discounting (hand coded). This model is an ensemble of mdlmsv1-mdlmsv3. Innovation covariance terms were chosen by optimizing the models marginal likelihood. The data was transformed using the logit function prior to analysis with a pseudo-count of 0.5 added prior to transformation to avoid numerical problems. All states are fit jointly.
