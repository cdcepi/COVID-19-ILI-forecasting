methods: Bayesian Multivariate Dynamic Linear Model with covariance discounting (hand coded). Past flu data was modeled using an ARMA(52,3) component and the past 10 weeks were additionally modeled using a 3rd order polynomial trend. Innovation covariance terms were chosen by optimizing the models marginal likelihood. The data was transformed using the logit function prior to analysis with a pseudo-count of 0.5 added prior to transformation to avoid numerical problems. All states are fit jointly.
