data_source1: ilinet
data_source2: NULL
interventionsYN: Yes
interventions: mixed. We assume that continued social distancing and lockdown measures remain in place for one month and then are slowly relaxed over the following two months.
this_model_is_an_ensemble: TRUE
methods: This is an equally-weighted ensemble of the following models
  1. Three ARIMA models fit to ILINet data after performing a Box-Cox
  transformation and linearly imputing any missing values.  The ARIMA models
  differ by whether 0, 1, or 2 first differences are taken.
