  EpiCos is an ODE model developed to match the historical trends in wILI.  To
  combine the wILI with the model during the season, a variational data
  assimilation  method is used (sometimes called 4D-Var) to fit model parameters
  and initial  condition of the differential equation. For the data assimilation
  piece of EpiCos, a  prior distribution of the parameters is estimated by
  fitting the model to historical  data available by the time of the first
  forecast of the season, i.e. EW 40.
